# direct DB access vs API

ðŸ“… 14/10/2024

Yes, you can access the same MariaDB database directly from your React frontend, but typically it's not advisable to connect the frontend directly to the database. Instead, it's recommended to use an API (like the Spring Boot backend) as an intermediary between your React frontend and the database for security, scalability, and maintainability reasons. 

However, to directly access a database like MariaDB from a frontend, you'd need a database driver that works in the browser. There are some JavaScript libraries that allow direct SQL queries, but it comes with significant security risks (e.g., exposing database credentials and making the database vulnerable to attacks).

Hereâ€™s why it's better to use Spring Boot as a backend for your React app:

1. **Security**: If you connect your database directly to the frontend, you would need to expose database credentials in the client-side code, which is insecure and could lead to data breaches.
   
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Using a backend API like Spring Boot helps separate the logic. The frontend handles the presentation, while the backend processes data and communicates with the database.

3. **Validation and Business Logic**: The backend can serve as a layer to validate data and implement business logic before interacting with the database.

4. **Data Formatting**: The backend can format data from the database into a structure thatâ€™s easier for the frontend to consume, reducing the complexity of the client-side code.

If you still want to try direct access for learning purposes, hereâ€™s a high-level approach:

### Using Direct Database Access (Not Recommended for Production):
1. **Install a MariaDB JavaScript Client**: Use a library like `sql.js` or a WebSQL API to access databases from the browser. However, these are not designed for accessing remote databases like MariaDB.
   
2. **WebSockets**: In some cases, you can create a WebSocket connection to communicate with a database server for real-time data, but this also should be mediated by a backend.

### Best Approach:
Keep using Spring Boot to connect to your MariaDB database, expose the data through secure REST or GraphQL APIs, and fetch that data from your React frontend using HTTP requests (Axios or Fetch API).

Would you like guidance on improving your existing Spring Boot API or on how to securely fetch data from it in your React app?
