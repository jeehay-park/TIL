# newsletter in HTML

When sending a newsletter using HTML in an email, it is generally recommended to **use inline CSS for styling instead of external stylesheets or `<style>` tags**. This is because email clients have varying support for CSS, and many modern CSS features may not be fully supported or may behave differently across different email clients.

By using inline CSS, you ensure that the styling is directly applied to the HTML elements, and it is more likely to render consistently across various email clients. Here are some reasons why inline CSS is commonly used for email newsletters:

1. **Email Client Compatibility**: Many email clients, especially older versions, have limited support for CSS. Using inline CSS helps ensure that the styling is correctly applied and displayed across various email clients, including web-based clients, desktop clients, and mobile devices.

2. **Gmail and Webmail Clients**: Popular webmail clients like Gmail and Yahoo Mail often strip out or ignore external stylesheets, so inline CSS becomes essential to maintain the intended appearance of the email.

3. **Outlook Compatibility**: Microsoft Outlook is widely used in the corporate environment, and it has its own unique quirks with CSS rendering. Inline CSS is more likely to work consistently with Outlook.

4. **Mobile Devices**: Many email recipients access their emails on mobile devices. Inline CSS helps ensure a better user experience and consistent rendering on mobile platforms.

5. **Avoiding CSS Filtering**: Some email clients may filter emails based on external stylesheets, considering them potential security risks. By using inline CSS, you can avoid these filtering issues.

Despite the benefits of inline CSS for email newsletters, it's important to note that creating responsive and consistently styled email templates can be challenging due to the limitations of CSS in email clients. Therefore, it's a good practice to test your newsletters across different email clients and devices to ensure they display correctly for your audience.

In summary, when sending a newsletter via email, using inline CSS for styling is generally preferred to improve email client compatibility and ensure a more consistent appearance across various devices and platforms.

**Email clients like Outlook have limited support for CSS, and some CSS properties may not be fully supported or may behave differently compared to web browsers. This can lead to discrepancies in the appearance of emails between web browsers and email clients.**

One specific issue you mentioned is the border line being invisible in Outlook. This is likely due to limited support for certain border styles or border-radius in Outlook.

To address this issue and ensure better compatibility with Outlook and other email clients, consider the following tips:

1. **Use Simple CSS**: Stick to basic CSS styles and avoid complex or advanced CSS properties that may not be well-supported. For example, instead of using border-radius, consider using simple borders without rounded corners.

2. **Avoid External Stylesheets**: Inline CSS is essential for email newsletters to ensure better compatibility. Avoid using external stylesheets as some email clients may strip or ignore them.

3. **Test on Outlook**: Always test your email newsletters on various versions of Microsoft Outlook to see how they render. Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013 have different rendering engines and may display emails differently.

4. **Use Tables**: To create consistent layouts in email newsletters, use HTML tables for structure. Email clients, including Outlook, are more reliable in rendering table-based layouts.

5. **Test on Different Devices**: Test your email on different devices and email clients, including mobile devices, to ensure it displays correctly across various platforms.

6. **Use CSS Inliner Tools**: There are online tools available that can help you convert external CSS styles to inline styles, making it easier to implement inline CSS in your email templates.

**Remember that email rendering can be quite tricky, and achieving pixel-perfect consistency across all email clients is challenging. The goal is to create a functional and visually appealing email that degrades gracefully even in email clients with limited CSS support.**

By following these tips and best practices, you can improve the appearance and compatibility of your email newsletters across a wider range of email clients, including Microsoft Outlook.
