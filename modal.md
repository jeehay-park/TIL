# Modal and Popup

ðŸ“… 18/03/2024

"Modal" and "popup" are both terms used in user interface design to refer to elements that appear on top of the main content of a webpage or application, but they have slightly different connotations:

1. **Modal:**
   - A modal is a UI component that appears in front of all other content on the screen and typically requires the user to interact with it before they can return to the main content.
   - Modals often block interactions with the underlying content until they are dismissed or completed.
   - They are commonly used for important messages, alerts, dialogs, or actions that require immediate user attention or input.
   - Modals often have a semi-transparent background overlay to visually separate them from the rest of the page and emphasize their importance.
   - Examples include login dialogs, confirmation dialogs, and form submissions.

2. **Popup:**
   - A popup is a smaller, secondary window that appears on top of the main browser window but does not necessarily block interactions with the underlying content.
   - Popups can be either modal or non-modal. Modal popups require user interaction before the user can interact with the main content, similar to modals. Non-modal popups allow users to interact with both the popup and the main content simultaneously.
   - They are often used for less critical information, such as tooltips, context menus, or notifications, that do not require immediate user input.
   - Popups may or may not have a background overlay, depending on whether they are modal or non-modal.
   - Examples include tooltips that appear when hovering over a UI element, context menus that appear when right-clicking, and notifications that appear in a corner of the screen.

In summary, "modal" typically refers to a specific type of UI component that requires immediate user interaction and often blocks interactions with the underlying content, while "popup" is a more general term that can encompass various types of secondary windows or elements that appear on top of the main content.
