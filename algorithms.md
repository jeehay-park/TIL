It's challenging to provide an exact number of algorithms in computer science since the field is vast and continually evolving. However, there are thousands of algorithms documented in various areas such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, machine learning, cryptography, and more. New algorithms are also being developed regularly as researchers find more efficient solutions to existing problems or tackle new challenges.

As for essential and basic algorithms, there are several fundamental algorithms that are commonly taught and used across different areas of computer science. Some of these include:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort

2. **Searching Algorithms**:
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search

3. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm (for shortest paths)
   - Prim's Algorithm (for minimum spanning trees)
   - Kruskal's Algorithm (for minimum spanning trees)

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Fibonacci Sequence
   - Longest Common Subsequence
   - Knapsack Problem
   - Coin Change Problem

5. **String Algorithms**:
   - String Matching (e.g., Naive String Matching, Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm)
   - Longest Common Substring

6. **Numerical Algorithms**:
   - Euclidean Algorithm (for finding the greatest common divisor)
   - Prime Number Generation (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes)

7. **Data Structures**:
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
   - Hash Tables
   - Graphs

These are just some examples, and there are many more algorithms and data structures out there. Understanding these fundamental algorithms and data structures provides a solid foundation for further study and application in computer science.
