# organized project structure example

ðŸ“… 14/03/2024

Sure, naming directories can indeed be challenging, but it's essential for maintaining a clear and organized project structure. For the Redux-related files and directories described above, you could follow a convention like this:

```
src/
|-- store/
|   |-- actions/
|   |   |-- actionTypes.ts
|   |   |-- actions.ts
|   |
|   |-- reducers/
|   |   |-- index.ts
|   |   |-- sidebarReducer.ts
|   |
|   |-- store.ts
|
|-- components/
|   |-- SideMenu/
|   |   |-- SideMenu.tsx
|   |
|   |-- ...
|
|-- styles/
|   |-- styledSideBar.ts
|   |
|   |-- ...
|
|-- ...
```

In this structure:

- The `store` directory contains all Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and the Redux store configuration.
- Inside the `actions` directory, you have `actionTypes.ts` to define action type constants and `actions.ts` to define action creators.
- Inside the `reducers` directory, you have `index.ts` to combine all reducers and `sidebarReducer.ts` to define the reducer for managing the sidebar state.
- The `store.ts` file in the `store` directory configures the Redux store.
- The `components` directory contains UI components, including the `SideMenu` component.
- The `styles` directory contains all styled components, such as `styledSideBar.ts`.

This structure keeps related files grouped together, making it easier to locate and maintain them as your project grows.
