# 'key' prop in react

The `key` prop is a special prop in React that is used to identify individual items in a list of components. It is not a standard JavaScript prop and is only recognized by React. 

When rendering a list of components in React, it is recommended to provide a unique `key` prop for each item to help React identify each item and optimize the rendering performance. The `key` prop should be unique within the list and should not be used for any other purpose.

It's also worth noting that the `key` prop is not passed down to the component as a regular prop. Instead, it is used internally by React to track the components and their states.

In React, the `key` prop is used to help React identify individual items in a list of components. When rendering a list of components using the `map()` method, each component in the list should have a unique `key` prop. This helps React keep track of which components have changed and which ones need to be updated, which can improve the performance of your application.

The `key` prop should be a unique identifier for each component in the list. It can be any value that is unique within the list, such as an ID or a hash of the component's data. You should avoid using the component's index as the `key` prop, as this can lead to issues if the order of the list changes.

Here's an example of how to use the `key` prop when rendering a list of components in React:

```
function ListItem(props) {
  return <li key={props.id}>{props.text}</li>;
}

function MyList(props) {
  const items = props.items.map(item => (
    <ListItem key={item.id} id={item.id} text={item.text} />
  ));
  return <ul>{items}</ul>;
}
```

In this example, each `ListItem` component has a unique `key` prop based on its `id` property. The `MyList` component maps over an array of items and renders a `ListItem` component for each item, passing the `id` and `text` properties as props. The `key` prop helps React keep track of which `ListItem` components have changed and which ones need to be updated.
