# `npm run deploy`

ðŸ“… 11/12/2023

When you run the command `npm run deploy` for a React application, it typically triggers the deployment process to GitHub Pages through a series of predefined scripts and configurations in your project. Let me explain the typical flow:

1. **Deployment Script in `package.json`:**
   - In many React projects, the deployment configuration is specified in the `package.json` file under the `"scripts"` section. There is often a script named `"deploy"` that is responsible for deploying your application.

   Example:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
     // other scripts...
   }
   ```

   In this example, running `npm run deploy` executes the `gh-pages` command, which is a tool that simplifies the process of deploying to GitHub Pages.

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration:**
   - Your project may also have a specific configuration for GitHub Pages in the `package.json` file or a separate `gh-pages` branch in your Git repository. This configuration specifies where the build files are located and other settings.

   Example:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repo-name",
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. **Build Process:**
   - The `npm run build` command is typically run before deploying to generate the production-ready build files. This command creates a `build` directory containing optimized and minified assets.

4. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - The `gh-pages` command, when executed, takes the contents of the `build` directory and pushes them to the `gh-pages` branch (or another specified branch) on your GitHub repository. GitHub Pages then automatically detects changes in the branch and deploys the updated content.

5. **Automatic GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - GitHub Pages can be configured to automatically deploy from a specific branch. If you have set up GitHub Pages in your repository settings to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch (or another branch), it will automatically publish the updated content.

Make sure to check your project's `package.json` file, and possibly any additional deployment configuration files, to understand how the deployment process is set up. Additionally, review your GitHub repository settings to see if GitHub Pages is configured and which branch it is set to deploy from.
