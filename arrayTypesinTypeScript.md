# Array types in TypeScript

ðŸ“… 18/03/2024

Of course! Here are examples for different array types in TypeScript:

1. **Array of Objects** (`Array<{ [key: string]: any }>`):
   ```typescript
   const objectArray: Array<{ [key: string]: any }> = [
     { name: "John", age: 30 },
     { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
   ];
   ```

2. **Array of Strings** (`Array<string>`):
   ```typescript
   const stringArray: Array<string> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   ```

3. **Array of Numbers** (`Array<number>`):
   ```typescript
   const numberArray: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

4. **Array of Booleans** (`Array<boolean>`):
   ```typescript
   const booleanArray: Array<boolean> = [true, false, true];
   ```

5. **Array of Tuples** (Fixed-length arrays with specific types at each index):
   ```typescript
   const tupleArray: Array<[string, number]> = [
     ["John", 30],
     ["Alice", 25],
   ];
   ```

6. **Array of Union Types** (Arrays containing elements of different types):
   ```typescript
   const unionArray: Array<string | number> = ["apple", 10, "orange", 20];
   ```

7. **Array of Custom Types** (Arrays containing elements of custom-defined types):
   ```typescript
   interface Person {
     name: string;
     age: number;
   }

   const customArray: Array<Person> = [
     { name: "John", age: 30 },
     { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
   ];
   ```

These examples cover some common scenarios, but you can create arrays with elements of any type or combination of types in TypeScript.

If you have an object with varying keys, and you want to represent its type in TypeScript, you have a few options.

1. **Index Signature**: If you know the type of values but the keys are dynamic, you can use an index signature.

```typescript
interface DynamicObject {
  [key: string]: any;
}

const dynamicObject: DynamicObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  // Other dynamic keys and values
};
```

2. **Record Type**: If you know the specific set of keys but their values can vary, you can use the `Record` type.

```typescript
type DynamicRecord = Record<string, any>;

const dynamicRecord: DynamicRecord = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  // Other dynamic keys and values
};
```

3. **Using `any`**: If the structure is completely unknown and you want to allow any type of value for any key, you can simply use `any`.

```typescript
const dynamicObject: any = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  // Other dynamic keys and values
};
```

Each approach has its use cases, and you can choose the one that fits your scenario best based on your requirements and constraints.

To create a component that corresponds to the path `/systemkey/list/:keyName`, you can create a file in your `pages` directory named `[keyName].tsx`. The brackets in the filename indicate that `keyName` is a dynamic route parameter.

Here's an example of how you can create such a component:

```tsx
// pages/systemkey/list/[keyName].tsx

import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const SystemKeyList = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { keyName } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>System Key List</h1>
      <p>Key Name: {keyName}</p>
      {/* Additional content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SystemKeyList;
```

In this example, `[keyName].tsx` will match any path that follows `/systemkey/list/`, and the value of the dynamic route parameter `keyName` will be available in `router.query`. You can then use this value to fetch data or render content dynamically based on the key name.

The error you're encountering indicates that TypeScript cannot guarantee the type of the `item` variable when mapping over `Object.values(info1 ? info1 : {})`.

The `Object.values` function returns an array of the object's values, but it doesn't specify the type of those values. TypeScript infers the type as `unknown` because it cannot determine the exact type of the values beforehand.

To resolve this, you can provide a type assertion to inform TypeScript of the expected type of `item`. If you know the type of `info1` and its values, you can cast `item` to that type.

For example, if `info1` is expected to have string values:

```typescript
{Object.values(info1 ? info1 : {}).map((item: unknown, index: number) => (
  <td key={index}>{item as string}</td>
))}
```

Replace `string` with the appropriate type if `info1` values are of a different type. This type assertion assures TypeScript that `item` is of the specified type, resolving the error.
