It seems that there is a dependency conflict preventing npm from resolving the `@types/crypto-js` package. This conflict is likely caused by conflicting versions of TypeScript required by different dependencies in your project.

To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

1. **Force Installation:** You can try forcing npm to install the package despite the dependency conflict by using the `--force` flag:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/crypto-js --force
   ```

   However, using the `--force` flag may lead to potential issues with broken dependency resolution, so use it with caution.

2. **Legacy Peer Dependencies:** You can try installing the package with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, which allows npm to use an older, potentially incompatible version of dependency resolution:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/crypto-js --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   This approach may help bypass the dependency conflict, but it also comes with the risk of using incompatible versions of dependencies.

3. **Resolve Dependency Conflict:** You may need to manually resolve the dependency conflict by updating the versions of conflicting dependencies in your project's `package.json` file. Try updating the versions of `typescript` and other conflicting dependencies to compatible versions and then running `npm install` again.

Choose the approach that best fits your project's needs and proceed accordingly.
