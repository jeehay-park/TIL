# Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)

ðŸ“… 19/09/2023

Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a computer hardware interface standard that defines how various hardware components can be connected and communicate with the central processing unit (CPU) and motherboard of a computer. PCI is primarily used for connecting expansion cards to the motherboard, allowing the computer to use a wide range of devices, such as graphics cards, network cards, sound cards, and storage controllers. Here are some key points about PCI:

1. **History**: PCI was first introduced in the early 1990s as a replacement for older expansion bus standards like ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) and VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association). It has since evolved through several iterations, including PCI-X (PCI Extended) and PCI Express (PCIe).

2. **Physical Slots**: PCI cards are typically inserted into dedicated slots on the computer's motherboard. These slots come in different sizes and configurations, with PCI Express (PCIe) being the most common in modern computers. PCIe slots are available in various sizes, including x1, x4, x8, and x16, depending on the bandwidth requirements of the device.

3. **Bandwidth**: PCI Express offers significantly higher bandwidth compared to older PCI standards. This increased bandwidth allows for faster data transfer rates, making PCIe suitable for demanding tasks like gaming, video editing, and high-speed data storage.

4. **Hot Swapping**: Some PCI standards, particularly PCIe, support hot swapping, which means you can add or remove PCIe cards without turning off the computer. This feature is especially useful in enterprise environments where uninterrupted operation is critical.

5. **Compatibility**: PCI slots and cards are backward-compatible to some extent. For example, you can often use a PCIe x4 card in a PCIe x8 or x16 slot. However, the card will operate at the slower speed of the slot.

6. **Peripheral Devices**: PCI is not limited to graphics cards. It can be used to connect a wide range of peripheral devices, including network adapters, sound cards, USB expansion cards, RAID controllers, and more.

7. **Legacy Support**: While newer computers primarily use PCIe for expansion cards, older systems and industrial equipment may still utilize older PCI or PCI-X slots.

8. **Obsolete Standards**: As technology has evolved, some PCI standards have become obsolete. For example, the original PCI standard is rarely used in modern computers due to its limited bandwidth.

9. **Modern Versions**: PCI Express (PCIe) is the current standard for expansion cards and comes in various generations, including PCIe 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, each offering increased bandwidth and speed compared to the previous generation.

In summary, PCI is a hardware interface standard used to connect expansion cards and peripheral devices to a computer's motherboard. It has gone through multiple iterations, with PCIe being the most common and widely adopted standard in modern computers. PCI is essential for expanding a computer's capabilities by adding various hardware components.
