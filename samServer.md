ðŸ“… 12/02/2025

In the context of **customized chips** and **firmware issuance**, a **SAM server** could refer to a **Secure Application Module (SAM) Server** or **Secure Access Module (SAM) Server**. Here's how it fits into chip customization and firmware management:  

### **1. Secure Application Module (SAM) Server**  
- Used in **smart card**, **IoT**, and **embedded systems** industries.  
- Manages **secure key injection**, **cryptographic operations**, and **secure firmware updates**.  
- Ensures that only authorized devices receive **customized firmware** or security updates.  

### **2. Secure Access Module (SAM) Server**  
- Often used in **payment systems**, **transportation cards**, and **identity verification**.  
- Stores **encryption keys** and **authenticates transactions** for secure chip communication.  
- Can be involved in **custom chip provisioning**, ensuring each chip has the right security credentials and firmware.  

### **How It Relates to Your Case:**  
- If the **SAM server** is part of a **custom chip issuance process**, it likely manages:  
  - **Firmware deployment** to the chips.  
  - **Security key injection** for authentication.  
  - **Configuration of chip-specific settings** per customer requirements.
