# TLS (Transport Layer Security) 

ðŸ“… 05/02/2024

TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. TLS, and its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), are commonly used to secure web traffic, email, file transfers, and other types of data transmissions over the internet.

TLS operates at the transport layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and ensures that data exchanged between two systems is encrypted and secure. It uses a combination of cryptographic algorithms to achieve confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the transmitted data.

TLS is widely used to secure communication on the internet, particularly in the context of securing websites through HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). When you see "https://" in a website URL, it indicates that TLS is being used to encrypt the data transmitted between your browser and the web server, providing a secure and private connection.
