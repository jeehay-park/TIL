# error & bug

ðŸ“… 03/07/2023

The terms "error" and "bug" are often used interchangeably in software development, but they have slightly different meanings:

Error:
An error refers to a mistake or flaw in the logic or functionality of a program. It is a general term that describes a deviation from the expected behavior or an unintended outcome. Errors can occur due to various reasons, such as incorrect coding, faulty algorithms, incorrect assumptions, or invalid input. Errors can manifest as crashes, incorrect calculations, unexpected behavior, or incorrect output.

Bug:
A bug, on the other hand, is a specific type of error. It refers to a flaw or defect in software that causes it to behave in an unintended or incorrect way. Bugs are often the result of coding mistakes or oversights during the development process. They can cause software to crash, produce incorrect results, or exhibit unexpected behavior.

In summary, errors are the broad category that encompasses any kind of mistake or flaw in software, while bugs specifically refer to defects or flaws in the code that cause the software to deviate from its intended behavior. Bugs are a subset of errors. When developers encounter errors or bugs, they typically need to identify, debug, and fix them to ensure the software functions correctly.
