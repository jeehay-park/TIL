When you run `npm start` or `yarn start` in the terminal, the package manager does not check all the modules or dependencies. Instead, it executes a predefined script defined in your project's `package.json` file under the "scripts" section, specifically under the "start" script.

The "start" script is typically used to start your application or run a development server. It might run a command like `node app.js` or `nodemon server.js` to start your Node.js application, or it could execute a command to run a development server like `react-scripts start` for a React application.

The purpose of running `npm start` or `yarn start` is to initiate the execution of your application or development server as defined in the "start" script. It does not perform a comprehensive check of all modules or dependencies at that moment. However, if there are missing or incompatible modules required by the script or your application, it may fail with errors indicating missing dependencies. In such cases, you would typically run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install or update the necessary dependencies before running `npm start` or `yarn start` again.

To summarize, `npm start` or `yarn start` is used to execute the start script specified in your project's `package.json` file, which typically starts your application or development server. It does not explicitly check all modules or dependencies but relies on the presence and compatibility of the required dependencies defined in your project's configuration.

While it is true that running `npm start` or `yarn start` does not directly provide a speed advantage, the primary benefit of Yarn's parallel installation comes into play when you are installing or updating dependencies.

When you run `npm install` or `yarn install`, that's when the package manager checks for dependencies, resolves version conflicts, and installs the required packages. Here is where Yarn's parallel installation can potentially offer faster installation times compared to npm's default serial installation approach.

Yarn's parallel installation works by downloading and installing multiple packages simultaneously, leveraging the available system resources. This can be particularly advantageous when you have a large number of dependencies or when dealing with slow network connections.

In contrast, npm installs packages one by one in a sequential manner, which can be slower in certain scenarios. However, as mentioned earlier, npm does provide features like "npm ci" that offer faster and deterministic installation in specific situations.

So, while the speed advantage of Yarn is more evident during the installation or update of dependencies, the benefits of using Yarn go beyond just speed. Yarn also provides features like deterministic installs, reliable lockfile generation, and improved caching, which can enhance the overall development experience and ensure consistent and reproducible builds.

Ultimately, the choice between npm and Yarn depends on your specific project requirements and preferences. Both package managers are widely used and have their own strengths and trade-offs. It's worth considering factors beyond just speed, such as the ecosystem, community support, tooling integration, and your familiarity with the package manager when making a decision.
