`Transpiling` is the process of converting code written in one programming language to another language with a similar level of abstraction. In the context of React and Babel, transpiling typically refers to the process of converting JSX syntax into plain JavaScript that the browser can understand.

`JSX` is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It's used extensively in React to define and render UI components. However, the browser doesn't natively understand JSX syntax, so it needs to be transpiled into plain JavaScript before it can be executed.

`Babel` is a popular JavaScript transpiler that can convert JSX syntax into plain JavaScript using a set of predefined rules and plugins. Babel can be used in various contexts, such as transpiling ES6 code to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers or transpiling TypeScript code to plain JavaScript.

In short, transpiling is a process of converting code from one language to another, while preserving the original functionality and intent of the code.
