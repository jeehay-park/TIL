# network size

In the message you provided, "694B transferred over network resource size 193B," Chrome is indicating two distinct sizes:

1. **694B transferred over network**: This typically refers to the total amount of data transferred over the network during the entire request-response cycle. It includes both the request (sent from the client/browser to the server) and the response (sent from the server to the client/browser).

2. **Resource size 193B**: This likely refers to the size of the resource received as the response from the server. This is essentially the size of the data sent back by the server to the client/browser as part of the response.

So, in this case:

- The request size would be the total data transferred over the network minus the resource size, which is 694B - 193B = 501B.
- The response size would be the resource size, which is 193B.

Therefore:
- Request size: 501 bytes (B)
- Response size: 193 bytes (B)
