# What happens when you refresh a web page in a web browser

ðŸ“… 19/09/2023

When you refresh a web page in a web browser, the browser typically goes through a series of actions, but it does not necessarily erase all RAM data. Here's a typical behavior of a web browser when you refresh a page:

1. **Requesting the Page Again**: The browser sends a new HTTP request to the web server for the same URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that corresponds to the page you're viewing. This request is similar to when you initially loaded the page.

2. **Caching**: Browsers often cache certain resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and sometimes even the entire page's HTML content. Cached resources are stored in memory (RAM) or on disk to improve page loading speed. When you refresh the page, the browser may check its cache to see if it can use any cached resources to load the page faster.

3. **Server Response**: The web server processes the request and sends back a response, which typically includes the HTML content of the page, along with any other resources needed to render it.

4. **Page Rendering**: The browser then renders the page based on the new HTML content received from the server. It may reuse some cached resources (e.g., images and stylesheets) if they haven't changed.

5. **JavaScript Execution**: If there is JavaScript code on the page, it will be executed again. Any in-memory data or variables created by JavaScript during the previous page load may be reset or reloaded, depending on how the page is coded.

6. **Memory Management**: Browsers manage memory internally. They allocate memory for various resources, scripts, and rendered content as needed, and they may free up memory that is no longer in use. However, the browser doesn't necessarily erase all RAM data or clear memory explicitly when you refresh a page.

7. **Tab State**: Browsers often preserve the state of tabs and restore the previous scroll position, form data, and other user interactions when you refresh a page. This is done to enhance the user experience.

In summary, when you refresh a web page, the browser reloads and re-renders the page, but it does not necessarily clear or erase all RAM data. Cached resources may still be present in memory, and the browser manages memory allocation and deallocation internally. The exact behavior can vary slightly between different browsers and configurations. If you want to clear cached data and ensure a completely fresh page load, you can use browser-specific settings to clear the cache and cookies.
