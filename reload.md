# When a user clicks "reload this page" in the browser

ðŸ“… 12/04/2024

When a user clicks "reload this page" in the browser, the browser sends a new request to the server to reload the current page. Here's what typically happens:

1. **Browser sends a request:** Upon clicking the reload button, the browser sends a request to the server asking for the current page.

2. **Server responds:** The server processes the request and sends back the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other required assets that make up the webpage.

3. **Browser reloads the page:** The browser receives the response from the server and reloads the current page with the new content.

4. **JavaScript and CSS are re-evaluated:** If there are any JavaScript or CSS files linked to the page, they are re-evaluated and re-applied to the DOM.

5. **Any cached resources may be used:** Depending on the server's caching settings and the browser's cache, some resources may be retrieved from the cache rather than being downloaded again from the server.

6. **Page state may be reset:** Unless explicitly saved or managed (e.g., using session storage or local storage), the page's state will typically be reset to its initial state. For example, form data may be cleared, and any dynamic changes made to the page may be lost.

7. **JavaScript execution resumes:** If there are any scripts running on the page, their execution resumes after the page has been reloaded.

Overall, clicking "reload this page" essentially refreshes the webpage, fetching the latest content from the server and resetting the page's state, unless explicitly managed by the application.
