# state

ðŸ“… 14/02/2024

In React, "state" refers to an internal data storage mechanism that allows components to manage and maintain their data. State represents the current condition or values of a component and can be updated over time in response to user actions, network responses, or other events.

When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state. This enables dynamic and interactive user interfaces where components can respond to user input or changes in data.

State is typically managed within individual components using React's `useState` hook or through class components using the `this.state` object. It's important to note that state is local and specific to each component, meaning changes to one component's state do not affect other components unless explicitly passed down as props.
