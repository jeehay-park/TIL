The ability to perform calculations directly in the command line interface depends on the shell environment you are using and the features it supports.

PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for task automation and configuration management. By default, PowerShell does not support arithmetic calculations directly in the command line interface. However, you can use PowerShell's scripting capabilities to perform calculations by writing scripts or using specific cmdlets for arithmetic operations.

On the other hand, Git Bash is a shell environment that provides a Unix-like command-line experience on Windows. It is based on the Bourne Again Shell (Bash), which is the default shell for many Unix-based operating systems like Linux. Bash supports arithmetic expressions directly in the command line interface using the `$(( ))` syntax. For example, you can type `echo $((1 + 1))` in Git Bash to perform the calculation and display the result.

In summary, the differences in behavior between PowerShell and Git Bash when it comes to performing calculations directly in the command line interface are due to the differences in their underlying shell environments and feature sets.

In computing, a "shell" refers to a user interface that allows users to interact with an operating system's services and functions through command-line inputs. Shells interpret user commands and execute them, facilitating interactions with the underlying operating system.

The term "Bourne Again" refers to "Bash," which stands for "Bourne Again Shell." It's a pun on the phrase "born again," indicating that Bash is derived from the original Unix shell written by Stephen Bourne. The Bourne Shell (sh) was one of the first Unix shells and was developed in the late 1970s by Stephen Bourne at AT&T Bell Labs. It became a standard shell for Unix-like operating systems.

Bash, developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project, is an enhanced version of the Bourne Shell. It retains compatibility with the original Bourne Shell while adding new features and improvements. Bash has become one of the most popular shells in Unix-like operating systems and is commonly used on Linux distributions and macOS.

You're correct in noting the play on words in the naming of "Bourne Again Shell" (Bash). The name "Bourne Again" indeed implies a sort of "rebirth" or continuation of the Bourne Shell (sh) developed by Stephen Bourne. However, it's important to clarify that the term "Bourne Again" is not suggesting that Stephen Bourne himself returned to develop Bash; rather, it's a pun or play on words that signifies Bash as an enhanced and improved version of the original Bourne Shell.

The "Bourne Again Shell" was developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project, and its name was chosen to reflect its heritage as an evolution from the Bourne Shell. The wordplay with "Bourne Again" suggests that Bash is "born again" from the original Bourne Shell, inheriting its capabilities while adding new features and improvements. It's essentially a nod to its predecessor while highlighting its enhanced functionality and compatibility with the original shell.

Both "shell" and "terminal" are commonly used terms, but they refer to different things:

1. **Shell**: A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands. It interprets user commands and performs actions based on those commands. Examples of shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh (Z Shell), and PowerShell.

2. **Terminal**: A terminal is a program that provides a text-based interface to the shell. It allows users to enter commands and view the output produced by those commands. Terminals can be graphical or text-based, and they provide an environment in which the shell runs. Examples of terminal programs include iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, and Windows Terminal.

So, in summary, the shell is the command-line interface itself, while the terminal is the program that provides the interface for interacting with the shell. Both terms are often used interchangeably in casual conversation, but technically, they refer to different components of the command-line environment.

The term "Command Prompt" typically refers to the command-line interface provided by the Windows operating system. In this context, it's similar to a terminal in Unix-based systems (like macOS and Linux). 

So, to clarify:
- **Terminal**: Refers to the program or application that provides a text-based interface for interacting with the shell. Examples include iTerm2, Terminal.app (on macOS), and Command Prompt (on Windows).
- **Shell**: Refers to the command interpreter itself, responsible for executing commands and providing various features like scripting, variables, and control flow. Examples include Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell.
   
In the case of Windows, the Command Prompt provides the terminal interface, while the shell behind it is typically the Windows Command Processor (cmd.exe) or PowerShell.
