# the  main difference between ReactJS and React Native

- React JS is used to build the user interface of web applications (that is, apps that run on a web browser)
- React Native is used to build applications that run on both iOS and Android devices (that is, cross-platform mobile applications)
- React uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create mobile apps.
