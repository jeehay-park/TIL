# `npm` and `npx`

ðŸ“… 01/11/2023

`npm` and `npx` are both part of the Node.js ecosystem, but they serve different purposes:

1. **npm (Node Package Manager):**

   - `npm` is the default package manager for Node.js.
   - It is used to install, manage, and publish packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects.
   - You use `npm` to install packages globally (with the `-g` flag) or locally (in the project's `node_modules` directory) by adding them to your project's `package.json` file.
   - It is commonly used for installing build tools, development dependencies, and various other packages needed for your Node.js projects.

   **Example Commands:**

   - Install a package globally: `npm install -g package-name`
   - Install project dependencies (from `package.json`): `npm install`
   - Publish a package to the npm registry: `npm publish`

2. **npx (Node Package eXecute):**

   - `npx` is a package runner tool that comes with npm (npm version 5.2.0 and higher).
   - It is used to execute packages from the npm registry without needing to install them globally or locally.
   - `npx` is particularly useful for running one-time commands and tools that you don't want to install as global dependencies.
   - It automatically downloads and runs packages on the fly.

   **Example Commands:**

   - Run a package without installing it globally: `npx package-name`
   - Execute a specific version of a package: `npx package-name@1.2.3`
   - Run one-time commands, such as creating a new React app: `npx create-react-app my-app`

In summary, `npm` is primarily for managing Node.js packages and dependencies, while `npx` is a tool for executing packages, command-line tools, and scripts without installing them. `npx` is particularly useful when you want to run a package once or use a package for a specific task without cluttering your global or project dependencies.

Created git commit.

Success! Created ts-app-001 at D:\ts-projects\ts-app-001
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd ts-app-001
  npm start

Happy hacking!
