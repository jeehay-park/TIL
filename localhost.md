`127.0.0.1` is indeed the IP address reserved for the loopback interface on your local machine, commonly known as "localhost". 

When you access `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, you're referring to your own computer. It's a way to communicate with services running on the same machine without going through the network.

Here's what it means:

- **127.0.0.1:** This IP address is the loopback address of the IPv4 protocol. It points to the local machine itself, allowing network communications within the same device.

- **localhost:** It's a hostname that refers to the loopback address. When you use `localhost` in a web browser or any network configuration, it's equivalent to using `127.0.0.1`.

So, if you see `127.0.0.1` in a configuration file like your `hosts` file or HAProxy configuration, it's directing traffic to your own machine. For example, if you map `127.0.0.1` to a domain name in your `hosts` file, typing that domain in your browser will direct it to your own machine.

In your HAProxy configuration, you might see `127.0.0.1` used for backend servers or as a bind address if you want HAProxy to listen for incoming connections only on the local machine. This is useful for local development or when HAProxy is used as part of a local development environment.
