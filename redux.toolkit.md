# Redux Toolkit

- includes several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases:
    - store setup
    - defining reducers
    - immutable update logic
    - creating entire "slices" of state at once without writing any action creators or action types by hand
- also includes the most widely used Redux addons: 
    - Redux Thunk for async logic
    - Reselect for writing selector functions

### ðŸ”¨ installation : `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`

### ðŸŽ¯ three common concerns about Redux
- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
- "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

### Redux Toolkit includes :
- `configureStore()`: wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

- `createReducer()`: that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements. In addition, it automatically uses the immer library to let you write simpler immutable updates with normal mutative code, like state.todos[3].completed = true.

- `createAction()`: generates an action creator function for the given action type string. The function itself has toString() defined, so that it can be used in place of the type constant.

- `createSlice()`: accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

- `createAsyncThunk`: accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generates a thunk that dispatches pending/fulfilled/rejected action types based on that promise

- `createEntityAdapter`: generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalized data in the store
The createSelector utility from the Reselect library, re-exported for ease of use.

- RTK Query data fetching API

### RTK Query
- RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

- RTK Query is an optional addon included in the Redux Toolkit package, and its functionality is built on top of the other APIs in Redux Toolkit.
