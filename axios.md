# Axios

ðŸ“… 20/04/2023

Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js environment. When working with Axios, it is common practice to create an instance of the Axios object. This instance can be used to configure default settings that will be used for all requests made through that instance.

Here are a few reasons why developers may create an Axios instance:

Consistent configuration: By creating an instance, developers can set default configuration options for all requests made through that instance. This can include things like base URLs, headers, and request timeouts. By setting these options once, developers can ensure that all requests made through the instance will use the same configuration.

Code organization: Creating an instance allows developers to keep related code together. For example, if an application has multiple endpoints that require different authentication headers, developers can create separate instances for each endpoint and configure the authentication headers for each instance.

Testing: When testing applications that use Axios, it is often useful to create a mock instance that can be used to simulate network requests. By creating an instance, developers can easily swap out the real Axios object with a mock instance during testing.

Overall, creating an Axios instance allows developers to simplify and streamline the process of making HTTP requests, while also improving the flexibility and maintainability of their code.

In JavaScript, an instance is an object created from a class or a constructor function. In the case of Axios, when you create an instance of the Axios object, you are essentially creating a new object that inherits all the properties and methods of the Axios object. This new object can then be used to make HTTP requests, but with additional configuration options and customizations.

To create an instance of the Axios object, you use the axios.create() method, like so:

```
const axiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer xxxxx'
  }
});

```

In the code above, we are creating a new instance of the Axios object with a base URL, a timeout of 10 seconds, and an Authorization header set to a specific token. This instance can now be used to make requests to the API with these default settings. For example:

```
axiosInstance.get('/users')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });

```
By creating an instance in this way, we can reuse the same configuration settings across multiple requests, and also override them when needed. This can help make our code more organized, maintainable, and easier to test.


Axios and the Fetch API are both used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js environment, but they differ in a few key ways:

Browser compatibility: Axios is compatible with a wider range of browsers than the Fetch API. Axios works with all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11 and above, whereas the Fetch API does not work with IE11 and some other older browsers without the use of polyfills.

Request and response interception: Axios allows you to intercept and modify requests and responses using interceptors, which can be useful for things like adding authentication headers or logging. The Fetch API does not have this feature built in, so you would need to manually modify each request and response.

Default settings: As mentioned earlier, when you create an instance of Axios, you can set default configuration options that will be used for all requests made through that instance. The Fetch API does not have this feature, so you would need to manually set options like headers and timeouts for each request.

Handling errors: Axios automatically rejects requests that return a status code outside the range of 2xx, which can simplify error handling. With the Fetch API, you need to manually check the ok property of the response object to determine if the request was successful or not.

Data format: Axios automatically converts JSON data to JavaScript objects, while the Fetch API does not. With the Fetch API, you need to manually call the json() method on the response object to convert JSON data to JavaScript objects.

Overall, while both Axios and the Fetch API can be used for making HTTP requests, Axios offers some additional features and flexibility that can make it easier to work with, particularly when dealing with more complex applications or APIs.

When you create an instance of the axios library, you can customize its default behavior and settings, such as default headers, base URL, and other configuration options. This can be useful when you want to use a consistent set of options across multiple requests in your application.

After creating an instance of axios, you can import it into your modules and use it like you would use the original axios library. The reason you import the instance, rather than the original axios library, is because the instance has already been configured with your desired options and settings. So when you make requests using the instance, it will use the default settings that you specified when you created it.

However, it's important to note that the instance is still based on the original axios library, so you can use all of the same methods and options that are available in the original library. In other words, the instance is simply a pre-configured version of axios that you can use in your application.


# header vs headers

In the axios library, headers is an object that contains all the headers that you want to set for a request, while header is a single header that you want to set for a request.

For example, if you want to set the Content-Type and Authorization headers for a request, you can use the headers option to pass an object with both headers like this:

```
axios.get('/api/data', {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer xyz123'
  }
})
```
Alternatively, you can use the header option to set each header individually:
```
axios.get('/api/data', {
  header: 'Content-Type: application/json',
  header: 'Authorization: Bearer xyz123'
})
```
However, note that using the header option to set multiple headers will result in only the last header being sent with the request, as each header value overwrites the previous one. So it is generally better to use the headers option to set all headers in a single object.


#
In the context of web development, "headers" typically refer to metadata information about the HTTP request or response that is being exchanged between the client (e.g. web browser or mobile app) and the server. These headers are sent as a part of the HTTP protocol and provide additional information about the request or response.

Some common headers that you may see in the development tools include:

- Content-Type: Indicates the type of content being sent in the request or response (e.g. JSON, XML, text/html, etc.)
- Accept: Indicates the acceptable response types that the client can handle
- Authorization: Provides authentication information for the request
- Cache-Control: Specifies how caching should be handled for the request or response
- User-Agent: Provides information about the client making the request (e.g. browser type and version)
On the other hand, the "payload" refers to the actual data being sent in the request or response body. For example, if you are sending a POST request to create a new user, the user data would be included in the payload of the request.

In the development tools, you may see both the headers and the payload of a request or response listed separately for easier analysis and debugging. 

# useCallback vs useEffect
`useCallback` and `useEffect` are two different hooks in React that serve different purposes.

`useCallback` is used to memoize a function and optimize performance in certain situations. It returns a memoized version of the function that only changes if one of its dependencies has changed. This is useful when you need to pass a callback function as a prop to a child component, and you want to ensure that the function reference remains the same between renders, even if the component re-renders due to changes in other props or state.

`useEffect`, on the other hand, is used to handle side effects in a component, such as fetching data from an API, updating the document title, or subscribing to events. It takes two arguments: a callback function that performs the side effect, and an array of dependencies that determine when the effect should be triggered. The effect will be triggered on the first render and after every subsequent render unless one of the dependencies has not changed since the last render.

In summary, `useCallback` is used to optimize performance by memoizing a function, while `useEffect` is used to handle side effects and update the component state based on changes in dependencies.


You are correct that both `useCallback` and `useEffect` involve calling a function when a certain condition is met, but the purpose and usage of these hooks are different.

`useCallback` is used to memoize a function so that it does not get recreated on every render. It is typically used when passing a function as a prop to a child component, and you want to ensure that the function reference does not change unnecessarily, which can cause the child component to re-render unnecessarily. By memoizing the function with `useCallback`, you can ensure that the function reference stays the same as long as the dependencies provided to `useCallback` do not change.

On the other hand, `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in response to certain events or conditions, such as component mounting, updating, or unmounting. It is typically used to fetch data from an API, update the document title, set up event listeners, or perform other side effects that require interaction with the outside world. The function provided to `useEffect` will be called after the component has rendered, and can optionally return a cleanup function that will be called when the component is unmounted or when the dependencies provided to `useEffect` change.

So while both hooks involve calling a function based on a certain condition, the purpose and usage of `useCallback` and `useEffect` are different.


```
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function DataPage({ token }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get("https://api.example.com/data", {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      });
      setData(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }, [token]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [fetchData]);

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

```
In this example, useCallback is used to memoize the fetchData function so that it does not get recreated on every render. The function takes care of sending the Axios request with the stored token and updating the component state with the obtained data.

useEffect is used to call the fetchData function after the component has rendered, and whenever the fetchData function reference changes (which happens whenever the token prop changes).

By using useCallback and useEffect in this way, you can ensure that the token is stored securely in the component state and that the Axios request is sent only when necessary.
