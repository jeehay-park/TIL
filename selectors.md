# Selectors

- Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:

```
const selectCounterValue = state => state.value;

const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())

console.log(currentValue);
```
